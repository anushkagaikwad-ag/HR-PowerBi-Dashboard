Title: HR Analytics Dashboard 

Description:
The HR Analytics Dashboard is designed to provide comprehensive insights into key HR metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making. The dashboard encompasses various visualizations, such as slicers, donut charts, cards, a sunburst chart, stacked column chart, and clustered bar chart, covering aspects like salary distribution, employee demographics, attrition, and organizational structure.

Problem Statement:
The HR department lacked a centralized, visual representation of critical workforce data, hindering the ability to analyze and respond to trends effectively. Manual reporting processes were time-consuming and limited in providing a holistic view of HR metrics.

Solution Provided:
Implemented a dynamic Power BI dashboard featuring a slicer for quick filtering of salary, employee, and attrition data. Key visualizations include donut charts for job type, gender, department, and marital status. Additionally, six cards display total employees, total salary, total active employees, attrition count, attrition rate, and average age. A sunburst chart illustrates the relationship between business unit and department, while a stacked column chart visualizes employee distribution across age bands. Furthermore, a clustered bar chart presents a clear breakdown of job roles.

Tools used:
Microsoft Power BI.

Result/Benefits on the Outcome of the Implementation:
1. **Enhanced Visibility:** The dashboard provides real-time, consolidated insights, empowering HR professionals to make informed decisions promptly.
2. **Efficiency Gains:** Automation of reporting processes has significantly reduced the time spent on data compilation, allowing HR teams to focus on strategic initiatives.
3. **Strategic Planning:** Access to detailed attrition data and workforce demographics facilitates proactive workforce planning and talent management.
4. **Improved Communication:** Clear and intuitive visualizations enable effective communication of HR metrics to stakeholders, fostering better collaboration across departments.
